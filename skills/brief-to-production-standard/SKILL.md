# Brief to Production Standard

By Maike Robert. MIT License.

Part of the [Context Sprint](https://github.com/maikerobert/context-sprint) method: this standard is the reference implementation of its Prototype and Build steps.

The most expensive mistake when building with an AI agent is building the wrong thing well. A polished screen that misread the briefing costs more than a rough one, because everyone has to unlearn it before fixing it.

This standard puts understanding first. The agent turns the briefing into a short summary, makes sure a design system exists, shows a quick prototype, and only then writes production code. Each stage ends at a gate where the user decides, and nothing moves forward without that decision.

When available, it works together with a code portability standard (build and commits), a web launch checklist (launch) and a copy review step (copy).

## The flow

| Stage | What happens | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Briefing | Context, rules, goals and references become a one-screen summary with assumptions and open questions | Together with gate 1 |
| 2. Design system | Reuse the project's design system, or create a minimum one before any screen | **Gate 1** |
| 3. Prototype | A quick HTML prototype, inside the design system, with real copy | **Gate 2** |
| 4. Build | The approved prototype rebuilt in the project's stack | **Gate 3** |
| 5. Git | Commits on the agreed branch and a pull request for review | After gate 3 |
| 6. Production | Launch with a web launch checklist, only when requested | **Gate 4** |

At every gate: show the result, list the decisions needed as numbered questions with a recommended answer for each, and stop. Move on only after an explicit approval ("approved", "ok", "go ahead", "pode seguir"). A change request means edit, show again and wait again.

Facts are the agent's job and decisions are the user's. Look up anything that can be looked up (files, repository, notes, earlier conversations) before asking, and ask only about what changes the result.

## Stage 1: Briefing

**Input.** Whatever the user sends: the briefing, business rules, scenario, audience, goals, constraints, deadlines, visual references (optional) and notes from meetings. When the user mentions a meeting, search the connected knowledge base (notes vault, Notion, drive) for its transcript and notes before asking anything.

**Output.** A summary that fits on one screen:

- Problem and audience: who uses it and what they need to get done.
- Goal and main conversion: what counts as success.
- Scope: what is in and what is explicitly out.
- Business rules and constraints.
- Page profile: public (site, landing page), private (dashboard, logged-in area, admin) or staging. It decides what the launch stage checks later.
- Target: prototype only, the project's repository, or production.
- Assumptions made to fill gaps, each one marked as an assumption.
- Open questions, numbered, each with a recommended answer.

If an open question blocks the design system or the prototype, ask it now. Otherwise present the summary together with gate 1.

## Stage 2: Design system first (gate 1)

No screen is built before the design system is settled.

1. **Ask and check.** Ask whether the project has a design system, and look for one in the repository (token files, theme, CSS variables, component library, documentation site) and in the knowledge base.
2. **If it exists,** list what the screen will reuse (tokens and components) and any gap the screen needs filled. New pieces follow the existing naming and style.
3. **If it does not exist,** ask for the logo, brand colors, fonts, references the user likes and anything the brand already uses. Then create a minimum design system:
   - Colors: brand, neutrals and semantic colors (success, warning, error, info), with text contrast checked.
   - Typography: families, weights and a size scale.
   - Spacing scale, border radius, shadows and breakpoints.
   - Components with their states: buttons, inputs (including error), selects, cards and alerts.
   - A reference page that shows every token and component, saved in the project.
4. Token and component names are in English (`color-primary`, `space-4`, `button-secondary`).
5. **Gate 1:** the briefing summary plus the design system (what is reused or what was created).

## Stage 3: Prototype to validate understanding (gate 2)

The prototype answers one question: did the agent understand what the user imagined?

- Build it as static HTML, CSS and JS in separate files, even when the project uses another stack. It is faster to see and to change, and it keeps the conversation on the product instead of on the code.
- Use the design system from stage 2. No new colors, fonts or components outside it without saying so.
- Mobile first, with the desktop version in the same prototype.
- Write real copy in the product's language. Review it for tone and clarity in that language. No lorem ipsum, no invented numbers, testimonials or claims; mark any copy that needs business confirmation.
- Include the states that matter for the flow: empty, loading, error and success.
- Publish it where the user can open it from any device, such as a private page with a link. A local file is the fallback.
- Iterate until approved, and keep a short list of what changed in each round.

**When a visual reference must be reproduced faithfully,** build it in layers and compare side by side with the reference at each one: structure first, then background and surfaces, then typography, then images and icons. Measure colors, spacing and sizes from the reference instead of guessing.

**Gate 2:** the prototype link, the list of changes and any open decision.

## Stage 4: Build in the project's stack (gate 3)

The approved prototype is the specification.

- If the project has a stack, follow it: its conventions, components, routing, state management and tests. Reuse design system components before creating new ones. Ask before adding a dependency or a framework.
- If there is no stack, the prototype's HTML, CSS and JS become the production code, cleaned up.
- Keep the code portable: English identifiers, comments and commits; no AI branding; no lock-in to embedded platform services; secrets out of the code.
- Change only what the screen needs and match the existing style of the codebase.
- Any difference from the approved prototype is flagged, never introduced silently.
- Before the gate, check: it runs locally, the build and tests pass, the layout holds on phone and desktop, keyboard and focus work, and it matches the prototype.

**Gate 3:** screenshots or a preview link, the list of changed files and how to test.

## Stage 5: Git

- Use the branch agreed for the project. Read it from the project's `AGENTS.md` or `README`; if it is not written anywhere, ask once and record the answer there.
- Never commit directly to the main or production branch.
- Commits in English, one purpose each, with no AI trailer. Run the portability check before committing when it is installed.
- Push and open a pull request with the briefing summary, what changed, screenshots, how to test and what is still pending.

## Stage 6: Production (gate 4, only when requested)

- Apply a web launch checklist with the page profile from stage 1 (indexing, analytics, accessibility, performance, forms, QA).
- Ask for the server details that are missing (host, access method, domain, environment variables). Secrets go into environment variables or the host's secret store, never into the repository, the pull request or the conversation summary.
- Deploy with a backup and a tested rollback path.
- Run the launch QA on the public URL. Report the page as live only after it passes.

**Gate 4:** the public URL, the QA result and anything that still needs a decision.

## Never

- Write production code before the prototype is approved.
- Build screens before the design system is settled.
- Use placeholder text, invented data or claims nobody confirmed.
- Skip a gate or deliver two stages in one turn.
- Push to the main or production branch.
- Add a framework, library or paid service without asking.
